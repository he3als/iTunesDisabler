# iTunes Disabler
A batch (`.cmd`) script to 'disable/enable' iTunes for Windows. Still in development but it should be usable and work... You can find releases [here](https://github.com/he3als/iTunesDisabler/releases).

**WARNING: This script is provided as is and I am not responsible for any damage done to your devices, Windows installation, iTunes installation and other Apple applications.**

## Warnings/notes
- Unplug all of your Apple devices before running the script! Also, do not forget to close iTunes and everything like that!
- I have no idea how running this script will work with iCloud installed... This is made for [Sideloady](https://sideloadly.io/#download) only, but feel free to test it out with iCloud and fix issues or even 'disable' iCloud.

## FAQ
- **Why would you want to disable iTunes' processes?** For me, I was having issues where they would randomly spike in CPU usage. I am also quite minimal on my Windows installation, I dislike stuff running in the background that I do not need. Plus, reinstalling iTunes just to sideload one app is fustrating.
- **Why is your batch scripting bad?** Not sure, but you can always contribute to fix errors!
- **I have found a bug, what should I do?** Report it on GitHub issues.
- **What can I do with this script?** Literally anything, read the license.
